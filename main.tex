In China, the state has fundamentally changed its information control strategies in response to the growing threat of virality on social media. In this paper, I outline the strategy of informational repression developed to combat this threat through cooperation between the state and internet communication technology companies (ICTs). Informational repression is a combination of covert information control and targeted repression. ICTs in China have increased linkages with state institutions, allowing surveillance and repression of carefully selected targets, and strategic cooptation of individuals with considerable influence on social media platforms. These dual strategies preserve the responsive and informational affordances of social media while mitigating the threat of social media as a conduit for instability. In this paper, I outline this strategy using evidence from government documents and process tracing of contention and cooperation between the state and ICTs. I then examine how this strategy works using a series of online experiments conducted in China. These experiments confirm that keeping information control covert is in both the government and private companies' best interests. Careful and covert information control, when paired with targeted repression, can mitigate the threat of virality while limiting backlash and chilling effects that can result from heavy-handed censorship. These findings demonstrate that the state and ICTs have converged upon a strategy of informational repression that maintains control over the internet while preserving a source of valuable information needed for responsiveness and control of threats to state control.

\section*{Introduction}

In China, the state has been experimenting with public opinion guidance in online social platforms for over two decades \citep{wei2015gongan,zou2015wangluo,xie2011zhongguo,xie2018zhongguo}. Over this period, the state has employed a mixed-strategy approach to information control, fitting into three main categories: content removal, content augmentation, and targeted repression. In this paper, I argue that the state and internet communication technology companies (ICTs) have converged upon a strategy of "informational repression" that targets individuals covertly, leaving as light a footprint as possible. This strategy is a significant departure from the widespread untargeted repression and censorship of the Mao- and early-Reform periods, and the categorical repression of the post-Tiananmen period (e.g., a categorical focus on well-organized, system-threatening collective action). Through a period of contestation with social media companies where state demand for content elimination was resisted by profit-minded ICTs, the state reluctantly gained an appreciation of softer, more targeted forms of repression and censorship. As \citep{han2018contesting} argues, impressions of pluralism and discourse competition in citizens' online interactions gives credence to state discourse without completely silencing competing discourse. In recent years, the state has learned to leverage the technological expertise of social media companies whose business model relies on effectively surveilling users' consumer preferences. Fine-grained surveillance of online behavior by technology companies is also useful for determining where the state should direct its repressive efforts. Leveraging digital surveillance to carefully target repression benefits the state in two ways. First, it limits the visibility of state interventions, giving individuals a perception of pluralism and discourse competition, and increasing their willingness to share their genuine opinions. Second, by carefully selecting citizens as targets of repression and censorship, the state avoids widespread backlash and chilling effects that often follow more brute-force, heavy-handed, or categorical censorship and repression.

In this paper, I focus on the first of these two benefits: how individuals respond to covert forms of repression in ways that benefit the state and ICTs alike. I trace the evolution of state involvement in—and contestation between the state and ICTs in China. I argue that through this contestation, a state strategy of informational repression has emerged. The strategy of informational repression combines digital surveillance and covert forms of repression to limit the visibility of state intervention, limiting backlash against the state and ICTs, while preserving the appearance of discourse competition online.

To explore how individuals respond to covert information control, I conduct online experiments with Chinese internet users. In these experiments, I present them with a fictional news aggregator, Now News, and direct them to test the platform before its future release. This platform is a fully functional news aggregator app that they can interact with as they would any news aggregator. A baseline version of the site will contain a mixture of favorable, neutral, and unfavorable comments about a proposed rideshare policy. To measure the effects of information control on perceptions of discourse competition, state support, and affinity for the fictional news aggregator, I randomly assign them to three different treatments which simulate three main categories of information control. An additive information control treatment includes additional favorable comments (astroturfing), a subtractive information control treatment removes all negative comments (content deletion), and a suppressive information control treatment informs them of content moderation of the platform. I also randomize the covertness of information control for each information control treatment. After instructing them to read the article and comments and explore the news aggregator platform, I ask them a series of post-treatment questions measuring their support for the rideshare policy, their experience on the fictional news aggregator platform, and their perception of discourse competition in the comments. I find that keeping information control covert is in both the government and private companies' best interests, as users in the covert treatment groups had appreciably more favorable views of both the state rideshare policy and the news aggregator site. Furthermore, those in covert treatment groups reported impressions of more discourse competition compared to those in overt treatment groups. These findings suggest that careful and covert information control, when paired with targeted repression, can mitigate the threat of virality while also limiting backlash and chilling effects that can result from heavy-handed censorship.

\section{The Logic of Informational Repression}

Recent scholarly work on repression has noted a decline in the visibility and overtness of violent repression \citep{fariss2014respect,fariss2019yes,guriev2019informational,hassan2022political} and an increase in softer, less visible forms of coercion---what \cite{davenport2005understanding} calls "covert repression." In China, this trend toward covert coercion has been noted in scholarly works on repression \citep{gallagher2021not,ong2018thugs} and censorship \citep{crete2016harmonize, ruan2021information, miller2018limits, miller2018delegated}. We know very little, however, about the state logic behind these changes in strategy, how they evolved, and how they influence citizens' compliance and attitudes toward the state.

In this paper, I argue that contention between ICTs and the Chinese state has led to the adoption of softer control methods. As ICTs mediate coercion in the online public sphere, conflicts often arise between the state and profit-minded ICTs who wish to limit censorship and repression, negatively impacting user experience. While early contestation was fierce, the state and social media companies reached an equilibrium. As evidenced in government documents, the state slowly realized that covert censorship, as implemented by profit-minded companies, was working in their favor. Keeping censorship and repression user-targeted, covert, and carried out by agents obscured state coercion from the view of average citizens. Partnerships and coercion between the state and ICTs allowed for careful curation of discourse through cooptation and repression of influential individuals rather than blanket bans on content which have backfired in the past. Encouraging those with considerable influence to operate within the bounds of acceptable discourse keeps state intervention in the online sphere hidden, thus benefitting the state's information-gathering efforts.

\subsection{Augmented Capacity through the Private Sector}

In 2011, the Chinese government began to experience a series of incidents that made the lack of effective control of explosively popular social media platforms surface. Starting with the Wenzhou train crash and culminating with the dramatic downfall of Chongqing Mayor Bo Xilai, the state found itself unable to control the narrative online. The urgency of the state's difficulty with social media became clear when Document Number Nine—which forcefully urged the Party to regain control of the ideological sphere online—was leaked.

After the experience of 2011 and 2012, the state made a strong push to augment the state's surveillance capacity by drawing on the technological expertise of the private sector. Hundreds of public opinion monitoring platforms emerged, with state-affiliated platforms from the People's Daily, the Global Times, and The Communist Youth League leading the charge. The state began to see social reach rather than categorical content bans as the way forward. A 2013 judicial interpretation reflected this insight and criminalized spreading rumors that were retweeted more than 500 times or viewed more than 5,000 times. \cite{miller2022improvising} and \cite{gallagher2021not} analyze the many government documents and manuals that were subsequently developed to help local governments build their online surveillance capacity. They found that a key focus of these documents was targeting online influence rather than content.

In 2014, Xi made efforts to consolidate control of the online sphere by reorganizing the regulatory institutions governing the internet, announcing the Cyberspace Administration of China. At this time, the government began focusing on artificial intelligence and big data as an economic objective but also as a critical pillar of social stability. AI and technological advancements in the private sector could help the state glean insights from the enormous social data generated online in China. In 2016, Xi called ICTs, "the Party's front line for public opinion work." Further, he focused his efforts on opinion leaders, saying, "we must strengthen education and guidance of online opinion leaders, we must encourage the good ones and restrain the bad ones, we cannot let things slide" \citep{creemers2017cyber}. According to a 2016 State Council document, in the first instance, surveillance and monitoring of public opinion were to be carried out by local governments \citep{statecouncil2016}. In response, a vast for-profit industry has emerged in China to identify threats, track public opinion ({\it yuqing}), and identify "emotional sentiment." State newspaper The Beijing News reports that nearly two million individuals work for hundreds of these public opinion monitoring platforms \citep{bjn2014}. These platforms purport to provide "public opinion early warning systems" that track errant content and identify who was the most instrumental in spreading that content. \cite{batke2020message} report on these for-profit companies in an analysis of thousands of procurement notices and corresponding documents, making clear the massive scope of this outsourced surveillance industry and the particular importance of opinion leaders as targets of state-outsourced surveillance. In 2020, the New York Times published a report on the enormous effort of these surveillance systems to control the narrative surrounding whistleblower Li Wenliang's death in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic \citep{zhong2020no}.

A notable article in a Party journal by Ren Xianliang, the director of the Shaanxi provincial Propaganda Department, suggests that Weibo influencers have exceeded the reach of Party-dominated print media. He laments, "If we do not take this seriously, but take a laissez-faire attitude, a 'broken window' effect is bound to ensue [...] we must dare to boldly confront those powerful media, famous websites, famous bloggers and Weibo Big Vs in terms of management, warn those that should be warned, shut up those that should be shut up, and close those that should be closed" \citep{creemers2017cyber}. On a similar note local government cadre manuals on opinion guidance urge local governments to ``[Pay attention to] ‘Big V’ users who have many fans and followers... [because they] decide the development of online opinion events or the formation of topics of discussion.'' To preserve authenticity and credibility, the manual stresses that cadres, ``maintain the relative independence of opinion leaders [...] co-opt those with different points of view, deal with individuals on a case-by-case basis, support [those with the] ‘correct’ [opinion] and repress/co-opt [those with the] ‘wrong’ [opinion].''

To supplement active monitoring of influential "Big V" users, the Party has focused on developing its own army of influencers. A cadre manual on "responsive governance and opinion response on Weibo" suggests that it is important to ``institutionalize specially selected opinion leaders, discover, cultivate, and train opinion leaders, as well as encouraging leadership cadres to act as opinion leaders.'' Over the last several years, social influence of local governments has become a part of cadre evaluation, with metrics and rankings of local government bureaucracies published annually by the People’s Daily Online Public Opinion Monitoring Center. By co-opting those outside the Party and building influence within the Party, the state has made great strides to control counter-hegemonic spaces online and increase the discourse power of the state \citep{gallagher2019who}.

\subsection{Exerting Control over ICTs}

{\it [To be added, review of regulation of social media companies, Party organizations within social media companies, and government investment/threats of expropriation.]}

\subsection{Targeting Repression}

How a state targets repression can have serious downstream consequences for collection of actionable intelligence on political threats. Indiscriminate, wide-scale repression, censorship, or propaganda can interfere with information collection by creating chilling effects or backlash from those who experience repression. This dilemma has been widely noted in recent literature on information control in China. \cite{huang2018pathology} finds that "hard" propaganda—overt, heavy-handed propaganda—is less convincing than softer, more covert propaganda. Relatedly, \cite{han2018contesting} argues that the perception that the state less heavily moderates online spaces can lead users to believe that the Party's narrative is indeed the dominant narrative.

Further, the belief that the state does not heavily moderate the public sphere can prevent chilling effects that might adulterate the online public sphere, which serves as a reservoir of information on public opinion threats. \cite{gallagher2021not} find that the state is also careful about targeting censorship and repression to a particular subset of users with influence and social reach on the platform. This cautious targeting, I argue, has given the state in China a more credible read on public opinion in its surveillance of social media. 

Backlash and chilling effects can also be avoided by delegating censorship to non-government agents. In China, information control is carried out indirectly through directives to ICTs (cite my diss, cite the Esarey piece, cite Chris). It is thus unclear if information control or repression is being carried out by the state or an overzealous ICT platform. For example, when blanket censorship of LGBT content on Weibo resulted in an intense public backlash, the state blamed Sina's management and denied involvement in the censorship policy. Similarly, the state outsources violent repression to organized criminals and thugs to evict homeowners, enforce the one-child policy, and demobilize protesters and petitioners \citep{ong2018thugs}. As Ong argues, the state utilizes these tactics to "evade responsibility" and "augment the state's lack of capacity," going to great lengths to hide repression from view by carrying out their attacks late at night.

\subsection{Plausible Deniability}

In addition to the informational affordances of more covert political control tactics, limiting the scope of censorship to those with influence can prevent a costly backlash that can be counterproductive to the state's information control efforts. \cite{roberts2015experiencing,roberts2017censorship} has identified multiple instances where heavy-handed censorship has encouraged individuals to circumvent China's "Great Firewall" to seek out information that has been categorically hidden from view. Narrowing the scope of state targets of coercion and cooptation aids the state's political control efforts by limiting the potential for any fallout that may ensue because of repression.

\section{Overview and Typology of Information Control}\label{types_info_ctrl}

Information control is the systematic government manipulation of the visibility of information to the public. I suggest three main sub-types of information control based on how one can change the visibility of information: adding favorable information (using astroturfing, propaganda, etc.), subtracting unfavorable information (through deletion, shadow-banning\footnote{Shadow-banning is an information control tactic that is meant to prevent users from discovering that they have been censored. To users who have been shadow-banned, their post appears to be visible from the perspective of their user account (it might appear on their profile), while the post is invisible to all other users.}, etc.), or suppressing the expression of latent unfavorable information (by intimidating, threatening, or co-opting regime critics). In \hyperref[info_manip_dist]{Figure \ref*{info_manip_dist}}, I visualize these three subtypes of information control using a symmetric univariate distribution representing the probability that an individual receives information of a particular polarity (positive to negative). Positive values represent information favorable to the government, and negative values represent information unfavorable to the government. The government's goal in its information interventions is to make favorable information more visible and make unfavorable information less visible. Assuming that an unperturbed distribution of information is symmetric around a neutral viewpoint, \hyperref[info_manip_dist]{Figure \ref*{info_manip_dist}} depicts three ways the government could shift the mean opinion toward the same positive value $\mu^*$.

Though the average polarity of each of the three methods of information control visualized is identical, the variation in polarity across these three methods of information control differs significantly. The additive distribution, for example, has some probability mass at the negative tail, the suppressive distribution has slightly less, and the subtractive distribution does not have any.

Each intervention results in a distribution of information polarity with different levels of discourse competition. To the information consumer, the additive distribution would appear to have the most discourse competition, the suppressive distribution would have a small amount of discourse competition, and the subtractive distribution would have no discourse competition.

      \scriptsize{\it If the true density of opinions held by individuals in society is assumed to be symmetric around neutral viewpoint (zero), each of the three plots is an illustration of how each of three major information manipulation tactics can move the visible and expressed opinions toward the state's ideal, $\mu_{+}$.}\vspace{2em}
      \label{info_manip_dist}
    \end{center}
\end{minipage}

These three types of information control can also vary in their conspicuousness. In additive information manipulation, the state's identity as the information manipulator is sometimes present and sometimes obscured. In some circumstances, government bureaucrats participate in online discourse openly with the identity of a bureaucrat (i.e. their name and title are visible in their social media profile, they wear a uniform in their profile picture, or are posting from an official government account). In other circumstances, the bureaucrat will deliberately obscure her identity to appear like she is an ordinary citizen. Each type of information control in \hyperref[info_manip_dist]{Figure \ref*{info_manip_dist}} has overt and covert forms.

Of course, each of these tactics themselves differ in the degree to which the information manipulation is observed and the degree to which the identity of the information manipulator is identifiable. Subtractive information manipulation, for example, can only be overt or covert if the deletion of content is reported to the user, which in some cases it is. In most cases, comments are deleted without notice to the user. Suppressive and additive information control are more conspicuous in overt and covert forms than most subtractive information. Because suppressive information control seeks to dissuade individuals from posting anti-regime messages using carrots and sticks, the information control tactic is almost always observed. In additive information control, the information control tactic can be observed in the overt form if the resulting distribution of opinions is so skewed that it does not seem plausible to the user. In overt forms, the presence of opinions from state-affiliated individuals means this information control tactic is observed.

\section{Evidence from Government Policies Source Documents}

{\setstretch{1}
\epigraph{``Any dissemination of information involves an information selection process. During the process, there are a variety of `gatekeepers' such as content editors and webmasters who play a very important role in information selection and opinion guidance. These `gatekeepers' should not simply delete comments but focus on the art of guidance so as to persuade and move the masses.''\footnotemark\newline}{--- {\it Weibo Government Platforms and Responsiveness to Public Opinion} \citep[155]{zhang2014weibowenzheng}}}
\footnotetext{Original Chinese text: ``\zh{任何信息的传播都是信息选择的过程，期间充满了各种各样的“把关人”。网络“把关人”包括网站编辑，网管等，他们在信息选择，引导舆论方面至关重要。这些网络“把关人”在工作中，切记简单粗暴地删帖，注重运用动之以情，晓之以理的引导艺术，使网民产生理性和感情上的认同和共鸣。}''}

The Chinese public has grown accustomed to contestation and pluralism in the public sphere \citep{han2018contesting,lei2019contentious}. While Chinese citizens understand that the state regulates information through censorship and media controls, these restrictions are often not as noticeable or disruptive as one might think. Through years of experimentation with more open and social modes of publication and digital mass communication, the state has developed a principle of "guidance" instead of "deletion." Guidance is a process of subtle interventions to "channel" or "guide" public opinion without alerting netizens to the state's interventions.

This principle became widely used and recommended in government manuals after repeated failed interventions, the first being the bungled cover-up of the SARS epidemic. In the manual, {\it Online Public Opinion in Major Emergency Events}, the principle of "guide, don't delete" traces its roots to this crisis. According to this manual, the SARS epidemic demonstrated to the government that a lack of information transparency would only escalate an incident's severity. In the SARS crisis, lack of information transparency and heavy censorship led netizens to doubt the representativeness of the opinions they encountered and "damaged the image" of the government and official media. It ultimately led to the spread of conspiracy theories about the epidemic \citep[1-36]{gong2012zhongda}. One government opinion management manual suggests that repeated failed interventions such as the response to SARS "may ultimately lead to a people's revolution." \citep[259-273]{ren2013yulun}.

To avoid backlash such as that experienced during the SARS crisis, cadres were directed to maintain a semblance of discourse competition in online media: the manual emphasizes that "negative information management [should] go past filtering and censorship, and also ensure the free flow of information by encouraging more voices on the internet." Interventions should "guide the public to empathize with the government" and empower netizens to take over control of online public opinion \citep[12-15]{zou2015wangluo}. The government has stressed the importance of intervening early in a crisis to set the agenda---usually through cooptation and repression of opinion leaders \citep[180-194][]{zeng2015wangluo,zhou2011weibo}. Early intervention increases credibility as the subsequent discussion can be moderated such that it appears to come from "disinterested" sources outside the Party and government's direct influence.

\section{Survey Experiments}

While government policies and documents can provide evidence of the logic behind informational repression and the move toward softer, more covert repression and censorship, we have very little evidence of how these changes in coercive tactics affect citizen compliance and attitudes.

In my theory of informational repression, I suggest that covert information control has become a more dominant strategy as the outcome of this kind of information control works in both government and private companies' best interests. I argue that individuals who experience covert information control are more likely to believe the information they encounter is unadulterated by government intervention. More heavy-handed, overt censorship gives users a reason to question the authenticity and representativeness of the information they are exposed to. To explore how internet users in China experience covert repression, I design experiments to simulate the three types of information control discussed in the previous section (additive, subtractive, and suppressive), randomly assigning users to covert or overt subtypes.

\subsection{Experimental Design}

In all experiments, subjects answer identical pre-treatment and post-treatment questionnaires. Pre-treatment questions include demographic questions: age, gender, income, ethnicity, education, location, work unit, hukou (see \hyperref[pre_treatment]{Table \ref*{pre_treatment}} in the appendix). Subjects are asked to self-report their media exposure by asking them the variety of outlets and programs they are exposed to in print media, online media, social media, and television, as well as the extent to which they consume these media. Subjects are also asked several questions to measure political knowledge. Several covertly-placed questions measure government support.

Post-treatment questions measure the trust in state media, agreement with the rideshare policy, the impact of information control on user experience, the perceptions of discourse competition, and perceptions of how representative comments in the comment section are to opinions held by the public (see \hyperref[types_info_control]{Table \ref*{types_info_control}}). The full text of these questions can be found in \hyperref[post_treatment_1]{Table \ref*{post_treatment_1}} and \hyperref[post_treatment_2]{Table \ref*{post_treatment_2}} in the appendix.

In all three experiments, subjects are sent to a website outside the Qualtrics survey interface to perform "user testing" of a new design for a fictional news website, "Now News." The user testing interface loads in a new window when clicked from the Qualtrics survey. This user testing interface displays instructions at the top of the page. In the instructions, subjects are directed to "read the article, like or dislike comments in the comment section, and leave [their] own comment if [they] would like to." They are told that they will need to pay attention to the content of the article and its comments to complete the next round of survey questions. They are reminded of this in a pop-up modal when they scroll down to the comments section.

Below these instructions, a "live version" of the news site dynamically loads in a large frame. A loading screen leads the subject to believe they are being redirected to an external website.\footnote{The news site is modeled after the mobile version of the Sina News and the Associated Press websites.} The news site that loads is comprised of a news article and its comment section. See the text of the article in \hyperref[text]{Section \ref*{text}} and screenshots of the vignettes in \hyperref[interface]{Section \ref*{interface}} in the appendix). In all experiments, the user testing interface contains a summarized Global Times op-ed about a new government ride-sharing policy. I chose a Global Times article on ride-sharing services for the vignette because of the topic's salience, lack of political sensitivity, and the presence of an active online debate on the topic. The article was summarized by a research assistant and checked for errors and believability by two other research assistants, all of whom are native speakers. As Global Times is a state media outlet, the op-ed champions the new policy.

Subjects are advised that the article's comment section is live, with "actual user comments posted in real time." After interacting with the article, they continue to post-treatment questions. Comments displayed below the article are selected from the real comment sections of various outlets that have syndicated the original editorial to make the experience as realistic and externally valid as possible. Each comment has been categorized according to its polarity in support or opposition to the ride-sharing policy. The distribution of the polarity of comments varies across treatment groups, as do the identities of the comments' respective authors. Comments can be liked, disliked, or reported, and these user interactions are saved in a database to be used as behavioral outcomes. The position of the comments in the comment section has been randomly ordered on the page so that the position of comments of different polarities will not affect the outcome. The comment text, each comment's polarity, and each comment's position can be found in \hyperref[comments]{Table \ref*{comments}} in the appendix. Subjects can also leave their own comments, which appear dynamically in the comment section and are saved in the database as an additional behavioral outcome.

The baseline control group displays nine comments that are balanced according to their polarity: three pro-ride sharing policy comments, three neutral comments, and three anti-ride sharing policy (see \hyperref[baseline]{Figure \ref*{baseline}} in the Appendix for a screenshot of the comment section). This baseline control group is shared across all three experiments. For additive, subtractive and suppressive experiments, I simulate information control in overt and covert forms, as detailed in the subsequent paragraphs.

The first experiment examines additive information control (astroturfing) in overt and covert forms. Users in the additive experiment are randomly assigned to overt or covert treatments. Compared to the baseline of nine balanced comments (three positive, three negative, and three neutral). In both overt and covert treatments, an additional six pro-ride sharing policy comments are displayed to the user. These six comments have been randomly distributed among the nine comments in the baseline condition. In the covert treatment, the identities of these additional pro-ride share policy comments (their profile picture and their account name) resemble ordinary people (see \hyperref[CA]{Figure \ref*{CA}} in the Appendix for a screenshot of the comment section). In the overt treatment, they resemble government bureaucracies or bureaucrats  (see \hyperref[OA]{Figure \ref*{OA}} in the Appendix for a screenshot of the comment section). The users' identities in the comment sections are fictional but based on real user profiles from the Sina News and Sina Weibo platforms. A table of the overt and covert user identities can be found in \hyperref[uids]{Table \ref*{uids}} and \hyperref[uidgov]{Table \ref*{uidgov}} in the appendix.

The second experiment examines subtractive information control in overt and covert forms (content deletion). In both overt and covert treatment groups, negative comments are removed from the comment section, leaving three neutral and three positive comments. For the overt condition (see \hyperref[OS]{Figure \ref*{OS}} in the Appendix for a screenshot of the comment section), a notice at the top of the comment section reads, "Some comments may relate to content that does not comply with relevant laws, regulations, and policies, and have not been displayed." For the covert subtractive condition, no such notice is displayed (see \hyperref[CS]{Figure \ref*{CS}} in the Appendix for a screenshot of the comment section). In both treatment conditions, the number of comments is displayed (9 comments) with an additional notice in parentheses that reads, "3 comments not shown."

The third experiment examines suppressive information control (notification of monitoring/surveillance). For these suppressive treatments, users are given a notice of comment moderation at the top of the comment section. For the overt treatment (see \hyperref[OSP]{Figure \ref*{OSP}} in the Appendix for a screenshot of the comment section), users are presented with a small cartoon of an internet police officer above the comment section along with the following notice: "In order to protect the safety and quality experience of our users, this platform is supervised by internet police." For the covert treatment (see \hyperref[CSP]{Figure \ref*{CSP}} in the Appendix for a screenshot of the comment section), users are presented with the Now News logo and the following notice: "In order to protect the safety and quality experience of our users, this platform is supervised by our staff."

After subjects interact with the website testing interface, they are directed back to the survey to answer a battery of questions measuring the perceptions of discourse competition, agreement with the editorial, trust in state media, and several other outcomes of interest (see supplementary information XXX)

\subsection{Hypotheses and Empirical Expectations}

In conjunction with the careful targeting of repression and censorship to those with influence, the logic of information repression involves covert information control to enforce social control to minimize backlash and preserve the informational affordances of social media. Covertness, I argue, works in both government and private companies' best interests, as it minimizes backlash against the state or private social media companies. As such, we should expect that overt information control will adversely affect trust in state media and user experience:

\noindent\underline{Hypothesis 1:} Overt information control results in diminished trust in state media (when compared to the baseline and its covert counterpart).\newline

\noindent\underline{Hypothesis 2:} Overt information control results in diminished user experience (when compared to the baseline and its covert counterpart).\newline

In authoritarian regimes, citizens know that information they consume does not come from objective and disinterested sources. \cite{stockmann2013media} finds that in China, citizens perceive semi-commercialized media as more independent than state media and are more inclined to trust these media sources. Just as perceptions of independence from state intervention can affect the credibility of information to consumers, opening circumscribed spaces for contentious discourse on a micro-scale can counter-intuitively increase the credibility of pro-regime information. \cite{han2018contesting} argues that the state benefits from online contestation because individuals distrust the intentions of those espousing anti-regime opinions, not because they are convinced by state propaganda. The presence of pro-government information and anti-government information suggests that there is some discourse competition and that the distribution of opinions in these forums may be unadulterated and representative of the opinions held by society at large.

In these experiments, because the distribution of opinions resulting from subtractive interventions results in no anti-regime viewpoints, there is less discourse competition than in additive interventions where negative comments are preserved. I thus expect that perceptions of discourse competition will be higher in additive than subtractive treatments. This is because observed opinions are less likely to be seen as unadulterated by state censorship in the subtractive treatment.

\noindent\underline{Hypothesis 3:} Subtractive information control will result in perceptions of lower discourse competition when compared to additive information control.\newline

\subsection{Experimental Results}

Consistent with the expectations of hypothesis 1, additive and subtractive covert treatments increased measures of media trust when compared to the baseline treatment when using our state media trust scale. Using a more straightforward question asking about the trustworthiness of nightly state news program {\it Xinwen Lianbo}, we only measured such an effect in the subtractive treatment (see \hyperref[ATE_media_trust]{Figure \ref*{ATE_media_trust}}).

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
    \vspace{1em}

        \label{ATE_media_trust}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{1em}
\end{minipage}

Finally, I find evidence that overt additive information control can lead to poor user experience. According to two measures of user experience, I found that users expressed greater dissatisfaction with the platform when information control was covert. In addition, I also find that covert treatments increase user experience when compared to overt treatments (see \hyperref[ATE_ux]{Figure \ref*{ATE_ux}}).

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
    \vspace{3em}
    \begin{center}
  		\captionof{figure}{User Experience Measures for the Additive Treatment Group}
        \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{figures/raw_ux.pdf}\\
        \label{ATE_ux}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{1em}
\end{minipage}

Additive and subtractive information control conditions significantly decreased subjects perceptions of discourse competition in the comment section (see \hyperref[ATE_discourse_comp]{Figure \ref*{ATE_discourse_comp}}). As expected, users perceived lower discourse competition in the subtractive treatment than in the additive treatment (hypothesis 3). And as there were no changes to the distribution of comments in the suppressive treatment, there was no observed effect on discourse competition compared to the baseline.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
    \begin{center}
  		\captionof{figure}{Perceptions of Discourse Competition by Treatment Group}
        \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{figures/ATE_discourse_comp.pdf}\\
        \label{ATE_discourse_comp}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{.5em}
\end{minipage}

While I sought to test heterogeneous effects, problems with data collection (likely due to the political sensitivity of the survey) left me with a smaller sample size than I originally intended. Because of this, there is not enough power to report results for heterogeneous effects.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

In this paper I introduce the strategy of informational repression in the Chinese context. The strategy of informational repression combines digital surveillance and covert forms of repression to achieve social compliance while limiting the scope and visibility of the states repressive tactics. I argue that informational repression limits backlash against the state and ICTs, while preserving the appearance of discourse competition online, resulting in a more-reliable source of information needed to respond to threats. I traced the process of state-ICT contestation that has led to this strategy. I then reviewed government documents and public statements that demonstrate a move to concentrate specifically on social influence.

To illustrate how covert information control can benefit both the state and ICTs, I conducted an online experiment with Chinese internet users. I found that covert tactics benefit both the government and private companies, as users in the covert treatment groups had appreciably more favorable views of state media and their experience on a fictional news aggregator site. Furthermore, I also demonstrated that covert tactics gave users a greater impression of discourse competition on the fictional platform. This suggests that covert information control can also give individuals a sense that the opinions they observe are representative, and that there is less intervention online. In sum, information control mitigates the threat of virality while also limiting backlash and chilling effects that can result from heavy-handed censorship.

Title: Timely Amend Internet-Based Ride-Share Policy\newline

\noindent Global Times Opinion: March 8, 2018 9:20 AM\newline

The internet-based ride-share policy has entered the full implementation stage. The policy is a major innovation and reform.

Internet-based ride-share services, as a classic model in the internet economy, is unique due to its cross-regional operations, which requires each locale to be innovative and flexible with their policies. However, the strictly local governance of the industry means that the cost of repeated auditing increases heavily and brings unnecessary burden to the services.

The internet-based ride-share policy is established to address these burdens and encourage the industry’s development. Therefore, local governments should reasonably relax their implementation policies in order to provide convenience transportation for passengers and counteract illegal taxi services by creating a sound resolution mechanism.

The internet-based ride-share policy aims to resolve safety problems and ensure the passengers’ legal rights by establishing a comprehensive mechanism that includes establishing barriers to entry on vehicle hardware, providing adequate insurance policies to drivers and ensuring rideshare services take more responsibility for vehicle safety.

Through a positive and cooperative mechanism which includes the government, the corporations, and the society, the remaining issues could be resolved.
